            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Test</h1><p>Test. Everything that is written here may be the result of my thinning or if my fantasising about life. Who knows which one is more important. Either way, I'm no longer sure if writing a journal by hand makes sense. This is simply because of the very act of sitting down yo write your thoughts taking more time and effort than using an app. Surely the app has not gotten enough attention from me even when I used it. Then again, the problem with a physical journal is that I never actually take the time to sit down and do it. Shouldn't I stay away from screens just for a small portion of the day?I believe so, but maybe general journaling isn't the right option. Maybe writing by hand is more of an emotional act. It is after all slower. In fact t is much slower than writing down notes like this. Let's see what I can do.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/50387c75-9334-46cd-b88d-faddfe4c2250.jpg"></article>]]></description>
